This is the preprocessor on the data in a trial mode
The data is fetched from hilltop api
The code is oriented towards processing HAWQi data

Since NBviewer on the Github doesn't allow dynamic html,
The current notebook has a limited functionality here.

A binder version will be made available at the earliest

The QaBay is the core module doing the heavy lifting
The hillDepth, by Jeff cooke does the retrieval of periodic observations
The widgetVer in addition to above to modules produces the results
